          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Smoking and Age, by State</h2>
          <p>There does not seem to be a significant correlation between the states' percentage of smokers and their median age.
            Of course, the story may change if the data was at the individual level and not at the state level - but unfortunately,
            the data we were given is at the state level.
          </p>

          <p>It is obvious that just having this one scatter plot with these twos variables is not enough to come up with any 
            sort of meaningful conclusions about the states. Luckily, this data set
            has other variables that we can use to derive conclusions about certain states.
          </p>

          <p>It is interesting to take note of the outliers in these cases. Depending on the nature of the study, 
            other inferences can be made as to healthcare/poverty levels. For example, we can look for 
            reasons why the median age for smokers in Utah is much lower than the rest... One thing that would be very useful
            is if the data set supplied the volume of people surveyed per state, since this way we dont have much insight into the sample size.</p>
